* bew
  this name is reversed web, for it will be less boring if use web in abnormal way:
  - not use client retrieve information, but setup server stream it
  - not boring waiting user get, push to them actively
  - not render on server, render on user's device
  - not use language as same as folks surround you
    - read pages written in non-native language
    - read machine language than human language
  - not GET oriented, but POST oriented
* feature
  - accept fs event 
    - mail
    - fold
    - log
  - accept HTTP upload
  - publish message to 0mq
* languages choosing
  do not choose among these meaningless options, should work on eio/ev
  by c and mainly focus on linux >2.6.24
  - ruby
    - event machine
    - 0mq ruby binding
    - rack
    - thin
  - js
    - node.js
    - 0mq js binding
  - c
    - subscriber wrapper
    - s0cat
    - mongrel2
* DONE fs event prototype [3/3]
  - [X] em and node.js both failed
    - can not report who changed
    - inotify implement can not report change in subdir
    - only get the notification then quickly check
  - [X] rsync method
    - algorithm is useful but it is too slow
    - rolling checksum
    - build list time
  - [X] scandir + stat
    - {struct timespec st_ctimespec : ino_t           st_ino}
    - Apple's scandir + tfind help and watcher sample are pretty cripple
    - (link "~/local/src/node/out/Release/deps/uv/src/unix/eio/demo.c" 4864)
    - eio's readdir is ready?
      - it is not magic, wrong macro inode and type, so sort doesn't works  
      - need write dir recursive
